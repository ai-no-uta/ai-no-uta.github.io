            Downloading Pandas in Windows

        <h3>
            Prerequisites
        </h3>
            <p>
                Note that this is a guide for Windows 10 specifically. First, make sure that you have <code>pip</code> installed. According to Wikipedia, <code>pip</code> should come preinstalled with version <code>2.7.9</code> and later for <code>python2</code> and version <code>3.4</code> and newer for <code>python3</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To check the version of Python you have, input <code>python --version</code> into Command Prompt. To check whether <code>pip</code> is installed, input <code>pip --version</code>. If <code>pip</code> is not installed, then Command Prompt will display an error along the lines of <code>is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                If <code>pip</code> is not installed, then rectifying that is your first line of business. Save <a href = 'https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py'>this page</a> as a <code>.py</code> file onto your computer and run <code>py C:\your_path_here.py</code> on Command Prompt.
            </p>
        <h3>
            Installing Pandas
        </h3>
            <p>
                Check whether Pandas is already on your computer by running <code>pip show pandas</code>. If it's installed, you will see a bunch of information about it, including the version number, a summary about what it does, and a link to <a href = "pandas.pydata.org">its official website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it isn't installed, you will see <code>WARNING: Package(s) not found: pandas</code>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, run <code>pip install pandas</code> into Command Prompt, and you should be good to go!
            </p>
        <h3>Running Pandas</h3>
            <p>Typically, you import Pandas with the line <code>import pandas as pd</code>.
