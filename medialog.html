    <h1>Medialog</h1>
        <p>
            In an effort to make myself engage more actively with the various media I consume (I have recently been taught to hate this word by picturing someone gorging themselves on junk food, but it's a convenient replacement for 'whichever one of read, listen to, or watch that is relevant'), in line with a comment I made on my <code>20205/07/15</code> journal entry, I will write excerpts reacting to them. This could be media of all sorts. News articles, scientific publishings, fiction, Wikipedia, Youtube videos, movies, TV shows ...

            <p>
                A video by Blue summarizing the culture and history of Greek Anatolia and arguing that it contributed to a lot to Greek Culture in the archaic period.

            <p>
                Greek Anatolia occupied the Aegean coast of the Anatolian peninsula and was subdivided into three regions. From north to south, they were Aeolis, Ionia, and Doris, which spoke their respective dialects of Greek. Blue talks mostly about Ionia and its city of Miletus, which he claims top possibly be the most important <em>polis</em> of the Greek world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Miletus traded with the Phonoecians and set up colonies along the Black sea coast as well as Naukratis in Egypt. The sanctuary of Apollo at Didyma, just outside Miletus, attracted people from all over the eastern Mediterranean. From their colony in Egypt they got a taste of Egyptian sculpture and architecture. Ionic columns were invented at the sanctuary of Hera at Samos, near Miletus. Homer came from Chios, an Ionian island. North of Chios was Lesbos, where Alchaeus and Sappho developed lyric poetry - the poet is a character of the poem. Thales also came from Miletus and pioneered Greek philosophy. Anaximander, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Herodotus, and Hecataeus were also from Miletus. Herodotus was from Helicarnassus, which was previously a part of the Doric hexapolis.

            <p>
                Blue then goes on to explain how the classical period saw Greek Anatolia be passed back and forth between the Persians and the Athenians, which caused them to drift from the center of the Greek world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last fact about Herodotus's background was something I found on Wikipedia - I don't think Blue mentions that. He presents Herodotus as Ionian, actually. I think that he should have clarified the development of the political structure of Greek Anatolia and its relations to its neighbours more carefully. 
            </p>

                I would be interested in hearing more about the people on the periphery of the Greeks: the people of the inland Balkans, the Black sea coast, the Caucauses, the rest of Anatolia ... People have a conception of Greece as being the birth of Western civilization, and while that may be true, I can't help but wonder whether the teachings of Greek thinkers survived as a function of chance rather than the quality of the intelect. What were the other people getting on to? Do we have sufficient archaeological evidence telling us that? Were they illiterate, their words destined to be lost to the wind, or can we be more optimistic? Or were they genuinely less cerebral people? I want to know.
            </p>

                More content about the prototypical classical world would be appreciated, too. As a public (state school for all you English folks) school-educated anglophone North American, our  classes did not engage at length with the Greeks or the Romans aside from reading from some compilations of Greek mythology, and even this was stripped of the historical context the stories emerged in. I know that Athens and Sparta and Thebes were cities, and the names of some philosophers and certain ideas of theirs, that Rome was a republic before it became an empire, that the Roman republic fought in the Punic wars against Carthage, that Julius Caesar played a role in the fall of the republic, but beyond that it's a bunch of question marks up until Diocletian and Constantine and then question marks further until Justinian and Theodora. And aside from the last clause, that scant information was osmosed through the years rather than learnt in school. And of course we did not engage with primary sources or translations thereof.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lack of engagement with primary sources is a huge thing in public school: we definitely spent more time reading about Montaigne and Erasmus and Martin Luther and Voltaire and Goethe than reading what they wrote. I think that this is fair; the class I took on European history in high school was AP Euro, which is exceedingly wide in breadth. There was certainly not enough time to give to each of the important individuals in European history their dues.

                Alas, I did not follow up on this in university. Through my years in undergrad, I took on the mindset of being perpetually consumed by the classwork that I thought I <em>ought</em> to take, rather than taking the time to actually discover some interests. But I can start doing so whenever, no?
            </p>

                The aside aside (hehe), I feel that my overall ignorance of the ancient world is common amongst North Americans. For all we like to talk about the influences of Greek and Roman thought upon our modern culture and institutions, there's a remarkable lack of knowledge on what Greek and Roman thought actually was, let alone a coherent argument for its influence. We should rectify that! It's good for the youth to engage with what smart people from another time and place argued, actually.
