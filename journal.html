			<h3>Flora</h3>
				<p>
					Today I saw a purple flower with five petals. It was a very low lying, non-woody plant. I imagine that some people think of them as weeds, which is a shame because they are awfully pretty.
				</p>

				<p> 
					I also went with a friend up to the edge of [burn] and mucked around for a bit. The bank is quite overgrown with bramble and ivy, so at first it seems inaccessible. But, there are paths that cut past all the vegetation to get up close to the stream. The water is unusually clear for today's rainy weather, as usually the rain washes sediment into the creek. What does persist in the water, unfortunately, is the hideous amount of trash. I feel that the people of this state should learn to respect the environment more. 
				</p>

				<p> 
					Many of the flowers I came across today are quite fragrant. However, excepting cheesewood, most of their scents are similar and one dimensional. They are powdery and do very little to stimulate my olfactory cells in an interesting way.
				</p>

			<h3>Logic</h3>
				<p>
					Last semester, I took an introductory course to (first order) logic. The crowning results of the class were the soundness and completeness theorems for first order logic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recall that a first order logic is a language with the power to write down predicates. When we think about what the meanings of formulas in first order logic are, we are interpreting these syntactic objects relative to a particular model. A model is a commonly understood mathematical object that imbues meanings to the symbols used in the first order logic.
				</p>

				<p>
					Moreover, we set up in class a formal proof system. We have a list of valid axioms; that is, a set of formulas that are true in any model (under any variable assignment). This is distinguished from the set of axioms we employ in a particular mathematical setting. We then have a number of rules that allow us to get from one finite set of formulas to another. In the system we had in class, this was just Modus Ponens; all other information was baked instead into the axioms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, the soundness theorem says: 'if you can prove one formula from a set of formulas, then that set of formulas logically implies that one formula.' In particular, if you can prove a formula from the axioms, it is valid.<br> The completeness theorem says: 'if a set of formulas logically implies a formula, then you can prove the latter from the former.'<br> How nice!
				</p>
				<p>
					I saw a Mathoverflow post a couple days ago where some logicians discussed the possibility of ZFC being consistent, but unsound. ZFC is generated by a set of sentences. What we mean by ZFC being unsound, then, is that some of what we can prove using ZFC might be false of our naive conception of set theory. As our deductive system is sound, this would mean that some of the ZFC axioms fail to reflect our naive conception of set theory. This does not mean that ZFC is inconsistent; it might just not be applicable to our naive conception of set theory.
				</p>
				<p>
					My problem with this is that we don't have a rigorous characterization of what our naive conception of set theory is! Wasn't this the motivation for formalizing things in 1st order logic in the first place? To rigorously characterize our naive conception of set theory? I do not see how this problem is well posed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ah, I see the issue now. The post discussed specifically whether or not ZFC would not apply to our notion of the natural numbers. Perhaps the natural numbers are still a naive, fuzzy thing; however, we do have intuitions about the truth/falsity of statements regarding them. That is slightly more palatable.
				</p>
			<h3>Euclidean Geometry</h3>
				<p>
					It is turning out that Euclid, although he only explicitly regards five propositions in his <i>Elements</i> to be axioms, relies on a whole series of implied truths to write his results. First, let me list Euclid's original axioms: 
					<ul>
						<li>For each pair of points, there is a unique line that passes through them. </li>
						<li>Given segments AB, CD, there is a point E such that B is between A and E and BE is congruent to CD. </li>
						<li>Given a point A and a segment AB, there is a circle with center A and radius AB. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			<h3>Philosophy of Science</h3>
				<p>
					I read an excerpt from a book about the philosophy of science today. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Its first topic was the demarcation between science and non-science. One criterion philosophers have used to do so is <em>verificationism</em>. Given a theory, we of course have an account of what observations follow logically from it. On the other hand, for a theory to be scientific, we also need an account of what observations would <em>falsify</em> it. In order to judge two competing theories, we would need to find an observable state-of-affairs which is deduced by one but whose negation is deduced by the other, and then design an experiment to see which arises.
				</p>
				<p>
					 A consequence of verificationism is that the meaning of a theory or proposition is exhausted by the observables it logically deduces.If two theories provide the same observables, then they are logically equivalent. The author gives the example of a hypothetical theistic account of a phenomenon begetting the same observables as an atheistic account, and hence the two being equivalent under this notion. I question this example. Theistic accounts are typically rather simple; something exists because a causer brought it about. However, this predicts precious few observables, about, for instance, characteristics of a phenomenon. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Take the example of lightning: the idea that Zeus hurls them at the ground predicts the existence of lightning, but not much more. Why does lightning occur in storms? Why does it precede thunder? Why does lightning spark fire? Why does lightning damage in the way that it does? Why does lightning show a preference for hitting certain targets? Why does hair rise before lightning strikes? A theistic account can be assembled post-hoc to justify some of these phenomena, but it can never make novel predictions. I get the allure of the example being provocative, but come on.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The author then contemplates the status of unobservables in scientific theories. Personally, I find the notion that something is observable if and only if it is perceptible to the common human senses arbitrary. There is still a mediating instrument in this case! They are undoubtedly primary instruments, but you nonetheless do not get a holistic conception of an object beamed into your brain from sensory input. The distinction drawn between things that are perceived immediately, and things that are perceived vis-a-vis technical instruments like microscopes or electrophotometers or Geiger counters, is not interesting.
				</p>
				<p>
					 Someone may object to the observation of theory-internal constructs. After all, scientific models have changed very frequently in the past. But on the other hand, I would like to point out that even intuitively differentiated things are not intrinsically so.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Can we not fathom some outside observer looking down at earth and seeing none of the individual organisms, the individual plants and animals and bacteria, but rather just writing off the entire thing as a homogenous mass of carbon? I do not think it so strange to assume, when working inside a scientific program, that evidence gathered in this manner counts as observing an object, while also happily admitting that, should the program be 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Of course, this should not allow us to post-hoc rationalize experiments as observing a particular theoretic entity. What should constitute an attribute of the entity should be given by the theory beforehand. 
				</p>

			<h3>Math Pedagogy</h3>
				<p>
					Trying to teach people math is a good way for me to structure my knowledge about the subject. While just learning the material for the first time, the theorems I encounter often seem like an uncoordinated jumble of facts, with little intuitive connections between them. Sure, I can follow my nose through a proof, but I have no sense of what conceit underlies the subject, or why we should care about it.This becomes clearer when I am forced to present to others. This even holds for things you might think trivial, like grade school arithmetic. At its core, the purposes of axioms in math is to sharpen an intuitive concept. Take for instance the example of arithmetic: we already have an idea of what we want to happen, so now we just need to provide a formal scaffolding for it.  On the other hand, as you progress farther in math, you typically do not have such an intuition for why what you are doing is meaningful.Building up this intuition while simultaneously presenting the mathematics rigorously is the difficult part of teaching. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					I have thus far written a chapter on Arithmetic for the perspective of someone with no background in math whatsoever. As such, I have the formidable task of both motivating the topic from scratch, as well as presenting it rigorously. In its current state, it is written with a very laid back, conversational tone, and I am concerned that this voice might cloud or gloss over facts I want to say explicitly. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					What should I have touched on? First, I look at the natural numbers. I take as fact that our process for adding things is well defined and has the properties that we expect of it. I hope that it has come across that we are doing this on faith. Indeed, we can reduce addition to recursion on the successor operation and give a set theoretic characterization of natural numbers, but that digression would be unmeaningful right now. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					We can then motivate multiplication as repeated addition. Here, I think introducing the formal definition recursively is less bad, as it basically mimicks how we think of the operation intuitively anyway. That the nice algebraic properties of multiplication then follow is not totally clear from the formalism, so perhaps an intuitive explanation would be in order. Moreover, as an introduction to mathematics itself, expecting the reader to write proofs by inductions from the get-go is both intimidating and uneducational.

			<h3> Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems</h3>
				<p> 
					How useful is it to know that a set is effectively enumerable? Recall that a set is effectively enumerable if it is either empty, or there is a computable, surjective function from the natural numbers onto it. Just knowing that a set is effectively enumerable, I am not sure that it is possible to tell which of the two kinds it is. 
				</p>
				<p> Given that a set is decidable, it is enumerable. Recall that a set is decidable if its characteristic function is computable. 
				</p>
				<p> Decidability implies effective enumerability. However, it is not clear to me that, given that a set is decidable, we can show in what sense it is effectively enumerable. Suppose we have the empty set, but it is given by a formula that does not obviously tell you that it begets the empty set. Then what? Is this not important? 
				</p>
				<p> In Peter Smith's book, he jointly treats a formal language as well as an interpretation with respect to the natural numbers. 
				</p>
				<p> He defines a formal language to be sufficiently expressive if it can express every effectively computable one-place function, and it can form formulas which quantify over numbers. The former criterion requires us to have some function and constant symbols, but how many, precisely? The latter just requires quantifiers.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The set of truths of a sufficiently expressive language is not effectively enumerable.

			<h3>My Thoughts on not being in the United States</h3>
				<p> 
					It was with a bitter, anxious, and confused heart that I bade farewell to the United States on the second of this month. It was not the departure that I wished for, but I hoped that it would be a departure that would improve me. I had at the beginning of May returned to the United States with the hope of finding some stability in familiarity. I had been residing in [city] for the past few years, and it had begun to feel like home for me.  [institution]'s ludicrous pastiche of Spanish-ish neoclassical and cold, soulless concrete blocks,  streets in the richer areas lined with too-expensive Italian restaurants and decorated with baskets of little pink and purple flowers  giving way to gutters of piss and shuttered, shattered storefronts in the ever-decaying downtown, my friends who were leaving one-by-one as they progressed in their education and careers ... Yes, I realized that there was less remaining for me than I had thought. My desperate clinging to familiarity clouded this fact to me. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But even then, one month was not a lot of time to pack ALL of my family's personal belongings and find a place to settle into elsewhere. But that's the lot that Customs and Border Patrol dealt me. The officer processing me was unimpressed by my verbal claims of familial financial support and promises to apply for jobs, so down goes the stamp: depart by [extremely soon date]. Argh! What a hectic month! At least I got some closure out of it. Taking far too long delayed graduation photos, meeting with my undergraduate advisor and friends and acquaintances ...
				</p>
				<p> 
					But this period of my life is now over. I find myself now in a country of which I'm a citizen and a city in which I was born and raised until [tender age], but quite frankly it feels rather foreign to me. It doesn't help that I have not sufficiently put myself out there, not sufficiently tried to deforeignize it. You cannot reap what you do not sow. I say not <emph>sufficiently</emph>, but still I am proud of what I have done. I have reconnected with friends from primary school, I went to a Go club, ... mrgh, this list is quite short. I will work to lengthen it. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Today could've been a better day. I woke up terribly late, on account of a misaligned sleep schedule that is slowly slipping into habit. I got out of the house terribly late, too. By this time, all the public facilities I like to work at have already closed. So I sort of wandered aimlessly, along a far-too-wide arterial (common in this part of the world), past a park, past a bench placed ambiguously on either public or private property (I debated on staying here, but I felt self-conscious knowing I was in the line of sight of people from their home), through a park full of people barbecuing and bugs champing at very-small bits to suck your blood, up a mixed-use street lined with sleepy Jamaican storefronts and modest brick-façaded houses before giving up and taking public transit back to my apartment where I have proceeded to hack away at the computer for the past seven or so hours. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					During this time, I have completed some probability exercises and am learning a <code>Python</code> package called <code>tkinter</code>. I plan on using this to create an applet that facilitates the editing of <code>.box</code> files more easily.  A <code>.box</code> file is what Tesseract OCR generates when fed an image with text to process, as well as what is needed to train it with. It contains the characters detected as well as the coordinates for a box in which they are contained. Unfortunately, currently existing editors for <code>.box</code> are rather miserable to use (push this button to increment the box one pixel to the right!), so I would like to make an alternative.  I would like to use the mouse to edit boxes in the vein of microsoft paint: click at one corner, release at the opposite one, and voilà a box is generated; drag the box around on its interior and resize on the boundary. I hope this will not be too hard to implement! Then, I can chug along with generating <code>.box</code> files to train Tesseract to recognize IPA symbols. The file I'm trying to OCR also contains Chinese, which got me wondering - how does Tesseract learn to recognize Chinese characters?  There are sooooo many Chinese characters, and in any given text, many of them occur very infrequently. Does one need to train it on ... literally all the characters? Or is there a way, by taking into text prediction data, for instance, to simplify this procedure? I hope that I will not have to train Tesseract on this also just because my document contains a mixture of character types. That would be ... time consuming. Alas! I cannot force an undergraduate student to do my grunt work for me. :(
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, now is time for bed. I hope to wake up timely tomorrow, but this I cannot guarantee.

				<p> 
					Today I've identified a common street tree planted in the city where I live. It has been perplexing me for the past couple weeks, as I have no recollection of seeing it as a child, and yet it is everywhere nowadays. This is probably due to my memory being rank,  as opposed to planting habits having changed over the past decade,  but perhaps this possibility is still worth investigating. The tree's little cream flowers come in small clusters. They're quite dainty and pretty, but I would say that the tree's most interesting trait is its foliage. It has two different kinds of leaves, seemingly!  One of them is birch-ish, mildly cordate, serrated, palmately venated, but the other is elongated, with relatively even width until the extremities. I imagine that the latter kind of 'leaf' might be a modified form of another organ, but alas I don't know enough botany to make this judgment. How are plant organs defined? Is there a rigorous definition of what constitutes a leaf? I am interested in learning about this further!

			<h3>
				Pandas
			</h3>
				<p>
					Lately I have been learning Pandas, both for employment purposes and because I think being able to do statistics effectively on large datasets is, like, a totally rad ability to have. I want to be able to draw conclusions and make recommendations based on evidence. I believe this ability to be applicable to a range of situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					In pursuant of this, I have started to maintain a Pandas tutorial here on my website. Please give me feedback on my wording (medium for comments will be set up ... someday)! I haven't had anything written of mine scrutinized in such a long time that I am probably condemning myself to a lot of bad habits...
				</p>
				<p>
					So far, I have tried to explain how to download Pandas and how to manipulate dataframes and series in very basic ways. But also, I'm not sure where to tread next - integrating Pandas with plotting packages? Probably.
				</p>
			<h3>
				Leaving the house
			</h3>
				<p>
					Today and yesterday were both unsuccessful in this regard! In hopes that tomorrow will be better, I should go to bed, like, right now. This cannot become a trend! I must be a well adjusted human. I must. Even if I scarcely interact with people, let alone get to know people, when I do go out. I cannot let my grass-touching slip farther out of reality...
				</p>
		<h2 id="2025/07/15">2025/07/15</h2>
			<h3>On taking it slow and methodically</h3>
				<p>
					I have trouble reading. This is a rather systematic problem, from getting the meaning of words up to having takeaways about the goals of the piece and the effectivity of the author at achieving them.
				</p>
				<p> 
					About words. I have heard often, since preparing for high school exit exams (at the latest; my memory is quite poor) the importance of using context clues at determining the meaning of a word. And I have become quite adept at this. To a fault. I do not commit words learned this way to memory. Their meanings do not crystallize. Each time I encounter them, I have to play this stupid game of getting a fuzzy notion of their meaning from context.
				</p>
				<p> 
					About paragraphs. The diligent author creates art with their words. There is not just surface level meaning. There are all these techniques, many of which we have named in high school - metaphor, simile, personification, blah blah blah. Authors allude to salient concepts in pop culture or parallelize their language to draw comparisons between two characters or events, or draw references to things that previously happened. They weave back and forth and conclude by tying the article back to the beginning with an elegant little ribbon. I shred through all of this. I don't notice things, and even when I do, it is only in a blithe, meta way - hah, the author's comparing their imagination to an ocean here. That's weird. I don't understand things in a deep or expansive way. At the most, I stumble across a disconnected little odd piece that I immediately forget when something more captivating captures my interest - the page count, usually.
				</p>
				<p> 
					About characters, themes, arguments... anything more central. I just don't get it at all. Characters blend together into a vague talking head. I don't individualize their motivations or emotions. I don't empathize with them. I don't, or can't even <em>try</em> to empathize with them. The protagonist could go from consistently sweet and kind to a raging monster and I wouldn't feel malaise at the out of character behavior. I wouldn't feel anything because I hadn't even noticed it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can tell you what an article is trying to get at, maybe; I cannot tell you whether they have succeeded in making a convincing point. I have two hats to put on: utter apathy or excoriating hypercriticism. I swap them capriciously (not based on the quality of writing) and both are useless.
				</p>
				<p> 
					I am an inattentive reader. My eyes scan through words and sentences and paragraphs and pages and chapters and I'm finished. Close the cover, and the book immediately fades away. There was ... a man? and a woman? and ... it takes place in Istanbul? More accurately: the book was never in me to begin with.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what do I do to rectify this? This will require effort. I need to force myself to write after I read a passage. This could be as simple as a summary of the text. I need to engage.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a sort of microcosm with how I need to approach life. I need to be more attentive, generally. To my relationships with people. To jobfinding (as much as it pains me to broach the subject). To the structure of my day. To my personal growth. To my past. 
				</p>
			<h3>On probability</h3>
				<p>
					It seems that you cannot get too far in probability theory without measure theory. Formulas litter the page without proof. How do you recover a marginal distribution from a joint one? Like this. Why does this work? Crickets.
				</p>
			<h3>On (Linguistics) Subreddits</h3>
				<p>
					This has distracted my attention - the word 'community' when referring to anything lower commitment than a network of people who meet and support each other. In particular, the term 'community' used in reference to online groups (and also, too a larger degree, communities built upon congenital, immutable characteristics). There are probably tight knit structures somewhere out there that fit the bill. This is <em>not</em> what I see a lot of the time on Reddit, however. What a banal website! For the moderator of a subreddit to refer to it as a 'community' is laughable in the cases I am familiar with. Nobody checks up on each other. Nobody discusses things in good faith. Very rarely do people even recognize the users they are interacting with. Certainly nobody actually cares about each other. Subreddits are 'communities' based on anonymity, which is to say communities built upon nothing at all. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Sorry! Onwards to what I have been planning on writing about. Reddit is a really fricking boring, intellectually anodyne website. Full of smug, condescending jerks who are more interested in being right than in constructive discussion. Or worse, people who are more interested in being annoying and mean and cruel than either of those. These same people often only have surface level knowledge of what they talk about, anyways.
				</p>
				<p>
					People on Reddit don't know shit. They regurgitate the same talking points endlessly. Go on linguistics Reddit. It's full of people who get their knowledge of linguistics from nothing other than linguistics Reddit. People regurgitate and reinforce the same few talking points over and over and over, not once taking the time to actually explore the research behind these mantras. Sapir-whorf is debunked. Altaic is debunked. Complexity is unquantifiable. Poverty of the stimulus. Chomsky is anglocentric. LLMs say nothing about human language development. Code switching is when diglossia (this one gets pushback from anybody who has taken a sociolinguistics class, at least). Descriptivism &gt; prescriptivism (this one really gets my goat. And my pet rabbit, too. What other scientific subreddit has people harping constantly about how to do science?).
				</p>
				<p>
					And entire subreddits get filled with nobody but people who repeat these slogans, people whose confidence gets bolstered not by academic rigor but by knowing that everybody else in the sphere repeats the same things. (Sometimes newcomers try to do so incorrectly and get chastised.) I think this is a reason why, when the r/linguistics and r/badlinguistics moderators decided to direct the two subreddits into a more academically rigorous direction, the discussion vanished, rather than adapted. Because there was nothing to be molded into serious discussion; there was only hot air. See r/linguisticshumor and r/asklinguistics comments for a lot of this.
				</p>
			<h3>On construction</h3>
				<p>
					Unceasing construction! Unrelenting construction! Cacophonous, ugly construction! No time to stop, no time to rest, no time to enjoy what we have. We need more, more, more. Always growing, always renewing, but never grown and never renewed. So when are we allowed to be content?
				</p>
			<h3>On the tone of today's posts</h3>
				<p>
					It's pretty negative, I know. I'm feeling rather grumpy. I'm sleeping far too late and my brain isn't braining. I hope that the tone lightens up as much as you do, but I think I'm being naïve by thinking that. Bleh.
				</p>
		<h2 id="2025/07/16">2025/07/16</h2>
			<h3>Learning Regex</h3>
				<p>
					Today I learned Regex. It is a technique to check whether a string has a property. For instance, we may want to see whether a string contains a capital letter. I can implement that with a lookahead: <code>^(?=[A-Z])$</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regex is pretty handy but I find how it works kind of unintuitive. I am not sure if I can't read, but I did not find a resource explicitly telling me that it searches from left to right, or that it ignores overlapping candidates when possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					For whatever reason, I find it really difficult to read code documentation. This may be because coding documentation is uniquely poorly written, but it may also be related to my general problems with concentration at the moment. I certainly don't recall MATLAB documentation being this incomprehensible when I was in undergrad.
				</p>
			<h3>On learning Javascript</h3>
				<p>
					Today I learned some Javascript. Previously, I had been disdainful of Javascript out of fear that it would slow down website loading speeds too much.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not sure of the validity of that claim. At any rate, this page here still loads snappily.
				</p>
				<p>
					My reasons for doing so is to create a dynamic table of contents. The fruits of my labour are displayed to the right of this very page!

				<h3>On architecture</h3>
					<p>
						The city in which I reside is not the most interesting architecturally. The suburbs, like most in North America, are very samey. Luckily the aesthetic adopted, while uniform, is at least pretty to look at. Lots of brick facades, rather than the endless plasticky looking panels you see in much the US. That juxtaposed with twenty storey condominium towers. Quite ... the juxtaposition. Luckily, it seems that in parts of the city, the juxtaposition is not as steep as I imagined when first arriving here. There is some midrise development: buildings 5-7 stories tall. I'm sure that it isn't nearly as evenly distributed as it is in [other large city], but it's alright.
					</p>
					<p>
						The city centre, though. Oooooh, the city centre. What a disaster! Not a block to be seen not perverted by glass, glass, glass, glass. The city has exchanged its soul for something cheap and infinitely scalable. Sure, I don't find glass to be an eyesore. The sun reflecting off glass buildings is ... well, literally an eyesore, but there is some beauty in its dazzling and twinkling and bouncing from surface to surface. What is not beautiful is what it stands for. A lack of identity, a desire to cut corners at every opportunity.
					</p>
				<h3>LaTeX</h3>
					<p>
						Curse this goddamn language (???) and whoever the hell decided that it's the standard for formatting math. It's so fricking ugly. The kerning sucks. The indents suck. The default margins suck. The default font sucks. There's no standard way to format integrals that people abide to. You have to download a physics package for the standard way to input derivatives. I've spent the last three hours of my life trying to format a theorem style. It's still so ugly. The documentation is godawful. People don't list all the parameters for their commands!!!! What on earth!!!! Who taught you to write documentation!!!! Who taught you that, when writing documentation, explaining the code was fricking unnecessary! Are people blind?

				<h3>On library norms</h3>
					<p>
						I feel like there is this popular image of libraries being a quiet place. I find it very easy to imagine a cartoon librarian - 60s with thick, horn rimmed glasses, the ends of its arms attached by a chain - butting her head into a crowd of unruly kids to shush them - <em>shhh! No talking in the library!</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is one reason why I have gravitated to libraries. But, as I settle in (?) to [city], I notice that is public libraries do not exhibit this characteristic. Okay, libraries are underfunded and understaffed; this is a narrative I would consider. But what does not make sense is that the loudest breachers of the peace are oftentimes the librarians themselves(?!) Is this a culture clash? Am I imposing social norms on this institution that are not characteristic of the city in which I reside? It is very bizarre.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would like to lament this, as someone who when going to the library expects peace and quiet. (Smother and stifle me if the majority opinion is not mine, I guess.) Surely librarians are a role model for expected library behaviour. I expect this to encourage its patrons to act similarly sooner or later.
					</p>
					<p>
						While they are the source for the majority of the noise, another that I have noticed is unsupervised children. I do not know whether their parents are present somewhere in the library and not overlooking them, or whether they have simply dropped off their children in the library while they do other things.
					</p>
					<p>
						This one, I hope everyone will agree with me as a lamentable state of affairs, as it likely reflects a lack of other alternatives. There are no other free, safe public spaces for parents to bring their children, so the library has to bear this burden. 
					</p>

						But also - please try to discipline your children about library behaviors! There is nothing more viscerally annoying than working in silence (or with the constant background noise of librarians chattering away) only for the setting to be pierced by a child screaming. (Don't discipline your children inside the library. Drag them outside and make them understand norms <em>there</em>.)

				<h3>On calculators</h3>
					<p>
						An upcoming engagement requires me to purchase a particular model of calculator. I have visited [chain store 1] and [chain store 2] and they have both failed to stock it. I am at a loss. In the United States, this is very easily purchasable, yet seems to be hard to source in this country... outside of Amazon. I would like to shop for it at other local retailers instead, but I am not sure where to look for it. Google maps is being quite useless.
					</p>
				<h3>On website design</h3>
					<p>
						I will have to say that the websites for [chain store 1] and [chain store 2] are less helpful than I would imagine. I thought that there would be an easily visible place for me to enter an address (or ZIP code, county, etc.) and for me to see availability at nearby stores. Moreover, I expected that the offerings on the website reflected what was stocked by the stores themselves, rather than third party sources of dubious recognition. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Generally, I feel I see a decline in people caring about website design. People don't try to optimize for navigability, or fast loading, or browser compatibility. They are pumped full of advertisements and poorly designed javascript widgets that break when you dictate your browser to implement modest security measures. The deterioration of the internet is plain for everybody to see.
					</p>
					<p>
						Frankly, I generally have a low perception of human competence at this point. Mail doesn't work, healthcare doesn't work, public transportation doesn't work, debit cards get declined at random, newly built buildings and newly paved roads crumble after a couple of months, when talking to some people it seems that I have to repeat myself multiple times before I am understood - or else I simply give up and go along with what they say (I imagine I am also guilty of communicative incompetence, admittedly...)
					</p>
					<p>
						The silver (or, like, maybe silica? Silver is a bit too positive) lining is that whenever anything does work smoothly I am pleasantly surprised. I suppose that I'm lucky to still have the reaction of pleasant surprise, rather than a reaction of suspicion at such things.
