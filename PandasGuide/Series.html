        <h1>What is a series?</h1>
        <h3>
            Introduction
        </h3>
            <p>
                When we grab a column of a data frame with <code>dataframe['column']</code>, we are left with a data structure called a series. What is it? What can we do with it?
            </p>
        <h3>
            Structure
        </h3>
            <p>
                A series is a kind of indexed list. If you got the series from a dataframe, the series inherits its indexing (recall that the indexing gives the names to the entries). There are, therefore, two ways of referencing a particular value in the series.
                <ol>
                    <li><code>series['a']</code> - Use the index to specify the value you need </li>
                    <li><code>series.hloc[n]</code></li> - Gets the <code>n</code>th entry of the series by counting from the first being the <code>0</code>th.
                </ol>
                While possible if the indexing doesn't include numbers, it is bad practice to use <code>series[n]</code> to indicate that you want the <code>n+1</code>th entry of the series.
            </p>
        <h3>
            Creating a series from scratch
        </h3>
            <p>
                You do this with the function <code>pd.Series(data =)</code>. Your data can either be a dictionary, such that the keys form the indices and the values the entries, or a list, in which case you introduce the indices via the parameter <code>index = []</code>. 
            </p>
        <h3>
            Vectorization
        </h3>
            <p>
                Series are vectorized. Loosely speaking, this means that if you perform an operation on a series that is meant for its entries, Pandas knows to perform the operation on its entries after all. The following examples will hopefully be illustrative.
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        series = pd.Series{data = [0,1,2], index = [0,1,2]}
                        series = series + 1
                        print(series)
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Output:
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        0    1
                        1    2
                        2    3
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                <code>1</code> is added to each entry of the series.
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        series = pd.Series{data = [0,1,2], index = [0,1,2]}
                        bool = (series == 0)
                        print(bool)
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Output:
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        0    True
                        1    False
                        2    False
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Each entry of <code>series</code> was judged whether it equaled <code>0</code> and the series of judgments was saved to <code>bool</code>.
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        series1 = pd.Series({'a':0,'b':1,'c':2})
                        series2 = pd.Series({'a':0,'b':1,'d':2})
                        print(series1+series2)
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Output:
            </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        a    0.0
                        b    2.0
                        c    NaN
                        d    NaN
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
                Pandas tries to match up correspondingly indexed entries in the two series and add each pair together. Note that when one of the series is missing a correspondingly indexed entry, the result for that index in the resultant series is <code>NaN</code>!
