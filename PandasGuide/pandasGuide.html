        <h1>Pandas Guide</h1>
        <p>
            This is a collection of articles I have written to aid people learning Pandas. Actually, I have some ulterior motives... I find that trying to <emph>explain</emph> something is often the best method for solidifying the concept for yourself, so this is also an autodictactic page. As such, I shall not languish if nobody ever sees it... (The young people refer to this sort of mollifying self-deception as 'cope', I believe)
