        <h1>French</h1>
        <p>
            It is a language spoken around the world due to colonization and in much of continental France due to restrictive language planning (France had and otherwise would have a very rich linguistic heritage - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Mistral">an Occitan writer</a> was awarded the 1904 Nobel prize in literature, in fact! But noooooooooooo God forbid diglossia exist in a country; we have to shame children for speaking their mother tongue!)
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides France, some other places where it is unrightfully spoken include:
            <ul>
                <li>Québec</li>
                <li>Acadia</li>
                <li>Louisiana (but here French was being oppressed in the 20th century, rather than being the one used for oppressing, so it feels a bit mean to rage against it.)</li>
                <li>Haiti</li>
                <li>Much of West and Central Africa (Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC, Senegal...)</li>
                <li>Lebanon, Syria, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am interested in learning a Québécois variety, both because I think it sounds cooler (love the diphthongs) and because I want to piss off Europeans.
