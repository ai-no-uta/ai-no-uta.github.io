        <h1>Rounding with Floor and Ceiling Functions</h1>
            <p>
                The floor and ceiling functions give ways to round to the largest/smallest integer less than/greater than a number \(x\), respectively (sorry for the phrasing of this sentence). Their use can be extended, however, to finding the largest/smallest multiple of any number of the form \(\frac{1}{n}\), where \(n\) is a natural number greater than \(0\), less than/greater than a number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following describes the method for just the floor function, as the method for the ceiling function is analogous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let \(x\) be the input number. Suppose that we want to find the largest multiple \(k\) of a positive number \(a\) such that \(ka &le; x\). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Equivalently, we wish to find the greatest \(k\) that is less than or equal to \(\frac{x}{a}\). Set \(k\) to equal \(\lfloor \frac{x}{a}\rfloor\). Then, our desired multiple is equal to \(\lfloor \frac{x}{a}\rfloor a\). 
            </p>
            <p>
                We can check that this works: \(\lfloor \frac{x}{a}\rfloor a &le; \frac{x}{a}a = x\), so this multiple is indeed less than or equal to our original number, and moreover \(\lfloor \frac{x}{a}+1\rfloor a > \frac{x}{a}a = x\), so defining \(k\) as we did gave us the largest such multiple.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the least multiple of \(a\) greater than or equal to \(x\) instead, I suggest you use the ceiling function. If \(a\) is negative, I believe that you will need to phrase the question differently (there is no greatest multiple of \(a\) less than or equal to \(x\), but there is a <em>least</em> one) and then to swap the use of floor and ceiling functions due to the inequality flipping when dividing by a negative number, but the overall process should work out.
