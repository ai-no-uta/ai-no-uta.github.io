            I'm a budding nerd. I like learning languages and geography, and lately I have been forcing myself to like statistics and working with computers as well. It has been surprisingly successful. I am also forcing myself to read and write more, so keep your eye on incoming posts. Or maybe not. As you can probably tell, the gears are kind of rusty. My writing is kind of staccato. Not in a deliberate way, but rather in a way that suggests I have forgotten what beauty is.

            Right now, there are a number of personal issues that I am grappling with. Those relevant to this website are my ability to concentrate on an issue at length (and therefore write something meaningful) and my ability to describe things accurately and elegantly (and therefore write something one would want to read). I hope that I can tackle both of these through this platform.

            On an equally nerdy but less academic note, I am also interested in plants and public transportation.
